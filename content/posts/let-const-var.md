The way we hold onto things on a programming language is using variables. The classic explanation of what a variable is to imagine a box which can store things. The purpose is to retrieve those things at a later time.

In JavaScript, the variables can be declared using `var` or `const` and `let`.

```javascript
var name = "clayton";
console.log("hello " + name);
```
