Hello, I'm Clayton. Welcome to my blog.

## Blog

I explain with code and words. I mostly share what I learn for my future self and others. I hope you find this content useful.

## My Journey

Born in India, living in the US. Trained to be a Mechanical Engineer, writing software. I work as a Test Automation Developer focussing on Test Infrastructure and tools.

## My Programming Journey

I'm a self-taught programmer. I started to learn programming using perl and then python, fell in love with it and embarked on a continous process of learning new skills and honing acquired ones ever since. I mostly use Python, JavaScript and SQL for work. I'm currently learning Rust.
