Hello, I'm Clayton.

I'm a Mechanical Engineer from India, who self-taught programming (perl and python), fell in love with it and embarked on a continous process of learning new skills and honing acquired ones ever since. I work as a Test Automation Developer focussing on Test Infrastructure for Dassault Systemes at Rhode Island, USA. I mostly use Python, JavaScript and SQL for work. I'm currently learning Rust.

This is my spot on the web to share what I learn for my future self and others. I hope you find this content useful.
