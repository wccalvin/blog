Hello, I'm Clayton.

I'm a Mechanical Engineer from Chennai, India, who self-taught programming and embarked on a continous process of learning new skills and honing acquired ones. I work as a Test Automation Developer focussing on Test Infrastructure for Dassault Systemes at Rhode Island, USA. I mostly use Python, JavaScript and SQL for work. I'm currently learning Rust.

This is my spot on the web to share what I learn for my future self and others, hope enjoy this content.
