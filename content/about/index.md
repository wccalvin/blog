## About
Hello, I’m Clayton. Welcome to my blog.

I’m a Mechanical Engineer turned Programmer. I work as an Automation Engineer for
[Simulia](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/), living in
[Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island).
My job focuses on building and improving the Test Infrastructure for Automation.

## Blog

I share what I learn with code and words for my future self and others.
The topics mostly revolve around programming and productivity.

## My Journey

I started to teach myself to code with [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) around 2013. The
first book I used to teach myself to code was the
[Llama book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-perl-5th/9780596520106/).
After a while, I started learning [python](https://www.python.org/), building
some useful things with it.

I spend most of my time writing Python, JS, and SQL at my job.
