## Blog

I mostly share what I learn for my future self and others. The topics mostly
revolve around programming. I hope you find this content useful.

## My Journey

I'm a self-taught programmer. I started to learn programming using perl in 2013.
The first book I used to teach myself to code was the [Llama book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-perl-5th/9780596520106/).
Then I learnt python using [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python),
started building some cool things with it and embarked on a continous process of learning to Program.
I mostly use Python, JavaScript and SQL for work.

I'm currently teaching myself [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/).
