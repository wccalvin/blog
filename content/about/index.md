## Blog

I share what I learn with code and words for my future self and others.
The topics mostly revolve around programming.

## My Journey

I’m a self-taught programmer. I started to learn programming using Perl in 2013.
The first book I used to teach myself to code was the [Llama book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-perl-5th/9780596520106/).
Then I learned python using [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python),
started building some cool things with it. I mostly use Python, JavaScript, and SQL for work.

I’m currently teaching myself [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/).
