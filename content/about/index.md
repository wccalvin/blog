## About

Hello, I’m Clayton.

I’m an engineer who likes automating things. I work as an Automation Engineer for
[Simulia](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/), living in
[Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island).

## Coding Journey

I started to teach myself to code with [Perl](https://www.perl.org/). The
first book I used to teach myself to code was the
[Llama book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-perl-5th/9780596520106/).
After a while, I started learning [python](https://www.python.org/), building
some useful things with it.

I spend most of my time writing Python, JS, and SQL.

## WEBlog

The intent of this blog is to share what I learn for my future self and others.
The topics mostly revolve around programming, books and productivity.
